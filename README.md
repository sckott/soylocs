## soylocs

These are restauarants we've called in portland that use soybean oil in their cooking. My better half has a soy allergy, and so we thought we'd share what we find. 

The map is at http://recology.info/soylocs/

Data so far includes only:

* Name of establishment
* Lat
* Long

Hope to add more info, especially notes about what things have soy and what don't.

Please do contribute! If you know of restaurants that use soybean oil, whether alone or mixed into vegetable oil, fork this project, add some data, and send a pull request. 

Forkme banner from http://codepo8.github.io/css-fork-on-github-ribbon/  - it doesn't show up on mobile by the way.
